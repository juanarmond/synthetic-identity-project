## Identity Island

**Identity islands** refer to clusters of identities that are variations of a central identity but contain slight differences. These islands represent various forms of the same individualâ€™s identity, with variations in their name, middle name, or other attributes. The idea is to simulate real-world scenarios where individuals may have multiple forms of identification or slightly different records in different databases.

**Key Concepts and Logic Behind Identity Islands:**
1. **Base Identity:**
   - The base identity is generated with key attributes such as a unique ID, name, date of birth, age, and nationality.
   - This identity serves as the root from which variations are created.

2. **Partial Names and Variations:**
   - Variations of the base identity's name are generated by manipulating the base name (e.g., adding a middle name, using a second name, etc.).
   - Each variation is also assigned a unique ID and retains the same date of birth and nationality as the base identity.

3. **Relationships within an Island:**
   - Edges (relationships) between the base identity and its variations are created. These relationships can be of various types, such as `IDENTITY_EQUIVALENCE`, `INCLUDED_IN`, `CITED_BY`, `IDENTIFIED_THROUGH_BIOMETRICS`, etc.
   - The graph structure represents the interconnectedness of the different identity variations, making it a cohesive island.

## Identity Island With Anomalies

Anomalies are introduced to simulate discrepancies and errors that can occur in real-world data. These anomalies help in testing the robustness of systems designed to detect and resolve identity-related issues.

**Types of Anomalies and Their Logic:**

1. **Duplicate Identity:**
   - A duplicate identity with minor changes (such as a slightly altered name) is created and linked back to the original identity using an `IDENTITY_EQUIVALENCE` edge.
   - This simulates cases where a person might have multiple identities with small differences.

2. **Inconsistent Reference:**
   - A reference document (e.g., passport, national ID) that does not logically match any identity in the island is added.
   - This can occur due to data entry errors or fraudulent documents, and it is linked to a random identity in the island using a `CITED_BY` edge.

3. **Mislinked Identity:**
   - An identity from a different island that has a similar attribute (e.g., name) is linked using an `IDENTITY_EQUIVALENCE` edge.
   - This represents cases where two different individuals are mistakenly linked due to similarities in their attributes.

4. **Incorrect Event:**
   - An event (e.g., biometric verification) that does not logically connect to the identities within the island is introduced.
   - Such events might be incorrectly recorded or linked to the wrong person, simulating data integrity issues.
