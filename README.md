# Synthetic Identity Islands Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to generate synthetic identity data, introduce anomalies, and use various machine learning models to detect these anomalies. The project leverages AWS Neptune for graph database capabilities and EC2 for running machine learning models.

## Key Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**
- **Anomaly Introduction**
- **AWS Neptune Integration**
- **Anomaly Detection**

For detailed information on each feature, please refer to the respective documentation pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
